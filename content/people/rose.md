Rose is passionate about putting people first.  It doesn't matter if a project is functional, if people can't use it joyfully then this is a loss to her mind. Rose brings a background in computer science to the table, as an experienced Front End Developer with hands on experience in the digital marketing space. Rose's interests include A/B testing, accessibility challenges, and the careful application of colours layouts and typography for a mutually beneficial experience. The way people feel about your presence is as important as having it work to spec - every second your users spend on your website or in your app is an opportunity to build a relationship that you can’t afford to miss. That’s why having a joyous presence is no longer a nice-to-have; it is critical to ensuring your ability to attract business, retain loyal users and accurately represent your brand.Since as far back as she can remember, Rose loved programming and solving problems. As an inquisitive child, she started playing computer games, spending time in gaming forums with other pre-teens and building a NeoPetz game guide. By the end of the seventh grade, she had self taught PHP. Her passion grew from there, and since then she's seized every opportunity to code, contribute to open source communities and teach clients about technology and it's impact on users.
