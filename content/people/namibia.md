Namibia joins Custom Programming Solutions as a Junior Engineer, and is growing her machine learning skill set while contributing to the team's Python projects. 

"The opportunity to work on innovative technology and build the best products for clients" attracted her to the role, she says. "The team is absolutely brilliant! Having the opportunity to collaborate with everyone on the team is an enriching experience. The work is exciting and challenging, and the best part is getting to problem solve on a daily basis."

Well-versed in using technology to influence change in user behavior, she' s passionate about creating stellar interview processes for technical candidates. She helps companies craft inclusive and enjoyable candidate experiences, retain excellent candidates and reduce recruitment costs. Her efforts also help her clients discover how they can best fill gaps in engineering teams.

Namibia was inspired to tackle the issue of recruitment and interview processes partly due to her own experiences interviewing for jobs when she first arrived in San Francisco, her current home. 

"I began to see flaws in the way interviews were conducted," she says, adding that as a researcher she spent about 70% of her time conducting interviews of new study staff and study participants. Through taking and conducting interviewer training, she picked up on the need for training technical interviewers in the tech industry. Today, she wholeheartedly believes that creating a compassionate candidate experience benefits both companies and candidates. 

"Creating a compassionate candidate experience is simply understanding that the person interviewing for the job is human, and not a cog in a machine. Showing the human side of a company will always maintain a great candidate pool, and attract people who are truly passionate about their work."

Previously, she worked as a backend engineer for a company that developed an employee feedback platform in Melbourne, Australia. She now works with clients worldwide to build great software.
