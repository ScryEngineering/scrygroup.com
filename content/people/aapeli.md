As co-founder and Senior Technical Consultant at Custom Programming Solutions, Aapeli partnered with Janis Lesinskis to take the company from concept to reality in early 2018. A problem solver at heart, he knew he had a big challenge on his hands when it came to building a software company he could be proud of.

Aapeli is our in-house blockchain and mathematics specialist and has a passion for using technology and abstract reasoning to solve complex problems with smart, creative people. He brings rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth expertise in cryptography, mathematical optimization and general systems architecture & development to his role. He also possesses experience in distributed systems, full-stack software engineering, data analysis and other areas.

> “I find cryptography very interesting,” he says. “The idea of having security that even the greatest nation-states won’t be able to break in the foreseeable future is very empowering and somehow oddly satisfying.”

Before joining CPS,  Aapeli designed and built intricate blockchain systems at a cryptocurrency startup whose mission was to build a cryptocurrency marketplace. At Biarri, a multinational logistics company, he extracted meaningful answers from big data to identify inefficiencies. At the University of Queensland, he studied mathematics, physics, statistics and economics, and graduated at the top of his class.

Today, Aapeli continues to hone his thirst for knowledge by studying for a master’s degree in statistics and mathematics at the University of Melbourne, with a special interest in blockchain and researching new systems. His dedication to helping others learn has motivated him to co-create eight-week boot camp training courses in blockchain, cloud apps, and machine learning.

In his spare time, he dabbles with creative coding and indulges his weird love for fonts and typography.
