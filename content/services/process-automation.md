## What is process automation?

Process automation (also known as Robotic Process Automation, or RPA) lets us use digital technology such as software to accomplish almost any task, workflow or activity we'd otherwise have to do manually. Think of your favourite accounting, marketing automation or batch file processing software. 

If you've ever used any of these and saved yourself or your staff hours of work, you understand the value of automation. Forget pulling your hair out writing code, putting in extra hours of manual labor (or adding an employee to your payroll), or spending time on tedious work when you could be using your skills elsewhere.

Here are just a few practical applications for process automation: 

- Expense tracking
- Data analysis and reports 
- Complex calculations and projections 
- Flagging transactions for human review or intervention 

Process automation integrates with data science and has many practical uses in the marketing, finance, manufacturing, retail and other industries.

## What process automation can do for you

Ever feel so overwhelmed by your to-do list that you don't know which task to tackle first? While you wonder how you'll get it all done, hiring an employee or sub-contracting doesn't seem practical, since you'd have to manage, train and pay them. 

But you have a viable alternative: automation. Software solves everyday problems in business. Whether 

there's a viable alternative that can speed up your turnaround time,  cut costs and save the hassle of hiring. 

Process automation can help you: 

- Save on labour costs 

  If you have employees on payroll, labour costs are likely one of your highest expenses. Automating tedious work is a cost-effective way to save revenue and eliminate dreaded tasks such as data entry from your employees' duties. 

- Find other efficiencies 

## The problem with minimum viable products in software

In the "worse is better" era, some software developers have abandoned the quest for a perfect user interface and experience in favour of shipping their product to market faster. There's been a gradual shift toward introducing minimum viable (less complete) products to beta testing for review, then releasing Version 1.0 early. 

The result: lower quality software. While this saves vendors money, early adopters (businesses like yours who need this software to work out of the box) pay the price in terms of:

- Poor interoperability with other systems 
- Missing features
- Bugs (errors) that must be identified, and worked around or resolved
- Manual data entry, including duplication of efforts 

Worse, software vendors may not prioritize fixing these defects. This leaves their customers frustrated, since they've invested valuable revenue in software they expected to work out of the box. However, the cost of replacing software and retraining staff on another vendor's product may be cost-prohibitive.
