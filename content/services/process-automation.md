## What is process automation?

Process automation (also known as Robotic Process Automation, or RPA) lets us use digital technology such as software to accomplish almost any task, workflow or activity we'd otherwise have to do manually. Think of your favourite accounting, marketing automation or batch file processing software. 

If you've ever used any of these and saved yourself or your staff hours of work, you understand the value of automation. Forget pulling your hair out writing code, putting in extra hours of manual labour (or adding an employee to your payroll), or spending time on tedious tasks when you could be using your skills elsewhere.

Here are just a few practical applications for process automation: 

- Expense tracking
- Data analysis and reports 
- Complex calculations and projections 
- Flagging transactions for human review or intervention 
- Onboarding new employees and customers 

Process automation integrates with data science and has many practical uses in the marketing, finance, manufacturing, retail and other industries.

## What process automation can do for you

Ever feel so overwhelmed by your to-do list that you don't know which task to tackle first? While you wonder how you'll get it all done, hiring an employee or sub-contracting doesn't seem practical, since you'd have to manage, train and pay them. 

But you have a viable alternative: automation. Software solves everyday problems in business, from compiling an error-free report for a pressing deadline to sending leads and customers the information they need in a timely manner. 

Process automation and optimization can help you: 

- Save on labour costs by eliminating the need to dedicate staff time to menial tasks 

- Integrate legacy systems and new applications to help you get the most out of your software

- Serve customers more efficiently so staff can focus on building relationships and activities that generate value

- Eliminate human error while increasing speed, productivity and efficiency in reports and other data 

- Enable other activities in data science and analytics such as reporting and statistical modeling

  

## Why work with us?

People drive your company's success. With the right tools and processes in place, they can ditch the manual labour and get back to bringing in revenue - the lifeblood of every business.

find efficiencies in critical areas such as internal communication, marketing, customer service and lead generation, human resources, data collection, reporting, and others. 

 It's critical to have the right partner who can 

We guide you through every step, including helping you to define which areas of your business will benefit most from automating and optimizing your processes. 

create systems to automate your most menial tasks 



The success of any project depends on having an experienced, highly skilled partner, a strategy customized to your needs, and clean data to work with.

There's a critical difference between techniques that are data-oriented and those that aren't. While performance engineering involves data and statistics, it can be done without either. Data is an intrinsic and essential part of data science projects, which always have data pipeline requirements. 

These two disciplines require drastically different skillsets. You need a partner who knows which one applies to your problem, and how to correctly build and implement a solid, cost-effective solution the first time.

We excel in this area, combining a strong background in mathematics with elite software development skills to solve complex problems and rigorously analyze data. When you work with us, we custom develop a precisely planned approach to address your specific challenge, then work with you to implement the solution.
