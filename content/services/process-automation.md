## What is process automation?

Process automation lets us use digital technology such as software to accomplish almost any task, workflow or activity we'd otherwise have to do manually. Think of your favourite accounting, marketing automation or batch file processing software. If you've ever used any of these and saved yourself or your staff hours of work, you understand the value of automation. Forget pulling your hair out writing code, putting in extra hours of manual labor (or adding an employee to your payroll), or spending time on tedious work when you could be using your skills elsewhere.
