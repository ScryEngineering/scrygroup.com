Technology exists in a broader context in businesses and organizations.
Even in the most technological of projects there will always be important non-technical components.
We have had an ongoing interest in understanding the context in which tech projects are done.
By understanding the context better we are able to solve the business needs far more efficiently.
Sometimes this means taking non-technical approaches to problems traditionally seen as tech and vice-versa.

We are well situated to provide advice on the following:

* If a problem is well suited to a technological solution and the profitability of such a solution compared with other options.
* Staffing and hiring decisions. We can give advice on both the impact of skills required and the overall market for candidates.
* Technical leadership and team management.

We bring a strong systems thinking approach to looking at technical strategy questions.
As much as possible we like to get an understanding of the domain in which the technology is being used so that we can help people make the most informed decisions related to their technical business decisions.
