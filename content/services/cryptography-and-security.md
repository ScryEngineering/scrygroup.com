## Cryptography: essential but challenging

Cryptography lies at the core of practically all modern day applications, guaranteeing the integrity and confidentiality of data, as well as the authentication of those accessing data and services. With the rise of coordinated industrial espionage by rivals, systematic hacking efforts by nation-state actors, and highly costly anonymous ransomware attacks; we increasingly depend on highly sophisticated cryptographic protocols to safeguard ourselves from these bad actors.

It is imperative then that the implementations we rely on are correctly used and bug-free, and that the protocols are appropriate and proved to be secure. Given the fragile nature and ease of misusing cryptography, even the most basic application of well known, standardised protocols is often difficult and requires an expert review to confirm the correct implementation.

When one ventures beyond the landscape of the ubiquitous and well studied protocols, the challenge of correctly using cryptography becomes orders of magnitude more difficult. Navigating the world of novel protocols, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different primitives is an extremely challenging endeavour.



Correctly implemented cryptography is imperative for modern day applications, protecting
