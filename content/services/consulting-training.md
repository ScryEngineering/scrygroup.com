## Learning, reimagined.

How often have you sat through a course, listened to a presentation or read a book and wondered how much you actually mastered the concepts? Now imagine a technology consulting and training program that teaches your team a whole new way to work - one customized to your needs, challenges and goals.

### We don't just teach you how to use technology. We teach you how to learn.

While most training programs use a top-down approach to teaching new tools and concepts, today's constantly evolving technological landscape demands a new approach to skills development. 

With extensive experience in and countless stories from the trenches of software consulting, training and development, we understand the critical importance of building a true partnership based on trust, transparency and experiential learning.

Instead of talking *at* you, we work *with* you to develop and implement a consulting and training strategy that gets results. We create a truly agile learning environment and share our knowledge in an interactive, collaborative context.

First, our experts in data science, machine learning and mathematical optimization collaborate with your team on a consulting basis.

The next step is to teach you the same cutting-edge technologies and meta-cognitive strategies we use every day, tailored to your requirements. From learning about open technology stacks and developing Python programming skills to knowledge transfer, improving communication and stakeholder management, you'll acquire valuable new expertise.

With this framework, you'll have the capacity to handle these projects in-house - no consultants required.

## How we work

No cookie cutter PowerPoints here! We believe a truly effective consulting and training program is results-driven and customized to your team's needs. That's why we work closely with you to build a strategy based on your needs, strengths and goals.

Here is our approach:

1. Define your needs:

    We meet with you to understand your team's strengths, goals and areas to improve, then plan a roadmap to get you there.

2. Build a custom strategy

   Every team is different, and yours requires a unique approach to achieve your desired results. Together we build a custom strategy with the precise mix of consulting and training needed to reach your goals.

3. Work with your team

   Time to put our strategy into action! Working in collaboration with your IT and technical support staff on a specific project, we use tools and tactics tailored to your team, needs and workflow.

4. Get ready to learn

   While we work, your team learns the vital "hard" and "soft" skillsets, as well as the tools and techniques to successfully execute projects in-house.
