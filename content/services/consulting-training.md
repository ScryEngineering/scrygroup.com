**Learning, reimagined.**

How often have you sat through a course, listened to a presentation or read a book and wondered how much you actually mastered the concepts? Now imagine a technology consulting and training program that teaches your team a whole new way to work - one customized to your needs, challenges and goals.

**We don't just teach you how to use technology. We teach you how to learn.**

While most training programs use a top-down approach to teaching new tools and concepts, today's constantly evolving technological landscape demands a new approach to skills development.

We understand the critical importance of building a true partnership, working side-by-side with you to develop and implement a strategy that gets results. First, our experts in data science, machine learning and mathematical optimization collaborate with your team on a consulting basis. 

The next step is to teach you the same cutting-edge technologies and meta-cognitive strategies we use every day, tailored to your requirements. From learning about open technology stacks and developing Python programming skills to knowledge transfer, improving communication and stakeholder management, you'll acquire valuable new expertise.

With this framework, you'll have the capacity to handle these projects in-house - no consultants required.

Steps:

1. Identify our client's technological and organizational needs 
2. Work with their technical support staff to implement these using the best tools and teach them about those tools as we go along 
3. Goal: Get them some sort of deliverables that satisfy their requirements and teach them the skills so they can do this work internally 

We offer a unique combination of skills our competition can't imitate. If hire unqualified consultants, they get poor deliverables if can't do the work. If they are unable to coach/educate your team, they might get good deliverables but not build that internal capacity
