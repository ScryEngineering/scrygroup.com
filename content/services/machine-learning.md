# Machine Learning and artificial intelligence

## What is machine learning? 

Machine learning involves algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task. The computer systems rely on patterns and inference instead of explicit instructions.

Machines learn by machine learning methods. These methods are classified as supervised or unsupervised learning.

**Supervised learning**

- Trains algorithms based on example input and output data labeled by humans 
- An algorithm learns by comparing actual output with taught output to find errors and change the model, then uses patterns to predict values on additional unlabeled data 
- Supervised learning uses labeled data to train the model



## What machine learning can do for you

Machine Learning algorithms are used when it would be impractical to build an algorithm to provide specific instructions to perform the task, including:

- Spam filtering 
- Healthcare, diagnostic predictions
- Recommendation engines to suggest movies or TV programs for users to watch next based on their preferences 
- Music suggestions





Machine learning lets you build efficiency into your business. By automating tedious tasks, you and your staff can take on higher value work to bring in more revenue.
