# Machine Learning and artificial intelligence

We can train machines to "learn" from past data and do what humans do, faster.

The more data we have, the better the statistical model will be, which will result in a more accurate outcome.

## What is machine learning? 

Machine learning is the process of creating functionality trained from data. A by-product of both traditional statistics and computer science, it involves algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task. 

The computer systems rely on patterns and inference  instead of explicit instructions. 

Machines learn by machine learning methods. These methods are classified as supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised (reinforcement) learning.

**Supervised learning**

Supervised learning uses input and output data labeled by humans to train the model. The algorithm learns by comparing actual output with taught output to find mistakes and change the model, then uses patterns to predict values on additional unlabeled data.


**Unsupervised learning**

Unsupervised learning doesn't provide the algorithm with any labeled data (using unlabeled data to train the model), allowing it to find structure within the data that's entered. The algorithm finds commonalities among input data, sometimes discovering hidden patterns within a data set to organize it in meaningful ways. 

**Semi-supervised learning**

Semi-supervised (or reinforcement) learning is behavior-based. The model is rewarded based on how it behaves, and makes decisions to earn as many rewards as possible. 





## What machine learning can do for you

Machine Learning algorithms are used when it would be impractical to build an algorithm to provide specific instructions to perform the task, including:

- Email spam filtering (It's not possible to create a set of all the rules to filter spam ahead of time because new spam is created every day. Instead, an adaptive system is trained on data being continually received.)
- Automatic transcription tools 
- Healthcare, diagnostic predictions
- Recommendation engines to suggest movies or TV programs for users to watch next based on their preferences 
- Internet searches 
- Personalized digital marketing 
- Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis

Machine learning lets you build efficiency into your business. By automating tedious tasks, you and your staff can take on higher value work to bring in more revenue.

## Why work with us?

With machine learning projects, it's imperative that the right data is chosen and the right problems identified during the discovery phase. Without highly specialized expertise in machine learning, you could end up wasting valuable time and revenue solving the wrong problem. 

That's where we can help. With years of practical experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we create and deploy machine learning systems with a wide range of applications, including Natural Language Processing and associated work.

You need someone with the expertise and practical experience to act as your partner, from the first conversation about your project to the packaging and launch stages. 

We help you prioritize tasks so you achieve the highest possible return on your investment

We have been involved in machine learning for many years now and have followed the various developments in the field.

Systems architecture has an enormous impact on the effectiveness  of a machine learning rollout since machine learning is a very complex field. In general, machine learning is a very resource intensive activity that's often bounded by resources available, this puts more stress on good systems architecture design.
