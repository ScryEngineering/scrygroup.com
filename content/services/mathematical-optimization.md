In business, anything that can be measured can be optimized and improved. 

From manufacturing processes and inventory control to packing, logistics, scheduling and even marketing, it's more important than ever to know your processes are as lean, mean and efficient as possible. That's where mathematical optimization can help; replacing best-guess estimates with proven algorithms and computer software, we can build solid processes to help businesses in a wide range of industries find cost savings and significantly increase productivity. 



## What is mathematical optimization?

With mathematical optimization, we leverage mathematical algorithms and computer software to improve processes.

By defining the problem and choosing the right equations, algorithms and systems to solve it, we can take the guesswork out of building solutions and identify a clear course of action to take.

Here are just a few practical applications for mathematical optimization:

- Manufacturing companies use objective functions to determine production costs, then use algorithms to optimize those functions to reduce costs.
- Warehouses and other buildings can be organized so every square foot of space is used as efficiently as possible.
- Transportation apps use mathematical optimization to find the best routes for their vehicles.
- Service companies (e.g. electrical) consider complex supply and demand formulas to determine pricing for commodities. Small efficiencies at this scale can add up to an enormous savings quickly.
- Airlines use systems to determine the fastest way for passengers to board an airplane. 
- Policy makers can use mathematical optimization to determine the popularity of policies a candidate wants to propose.

Mathematical optimization also has many practical uses in finance, engineering, economics, mechanics and more. 

### Background

More than 50 years ago, we discovered mathematical optimization can be used to improve organizational efficiency. In the past few decades, it's become much more accessible as computing power has grown significantly and some have declared that that ["compute moats are dead"](https://smerity.com/articles/2018/limited_compute.html). We can now explore the potential of mathematical optimization and [machine learning](/services/machine-learning), even with limited compute and data. 

At one time you needed expensive "supercomputing" resources as a bare minimum to enter this space. In recent years, technology has progressed to a point where the computers we carry in our pockets - modern cell phones that cost a few hundred dollars - boast more computing power than the iconic original Cray supercomputer. 

Today, you can combine high-power cloud computing services such as AWS with expertise in mathematical optimization algorithms to exploit the power of mathematical optimization for your organization - with minimal investment in hardware.

## What mathematical optimization can do for you

If you've ever wondered how you can tighten up your processes, find operational savings and use your staff's time and experience more  effectively, you've discovered a problem mathematical optimization can solve. Practical applications include:

- Logistics and transport 
- Warehouse planning (capacity and inventory)
- Scheduling and sequencing 
- Bin, box and container packing

Specifically, we can use the power of mathematics to:

- Reduce logistics costs 
- Reduce time required to create, deliver and stock inventory 
- Improve productivity 



## Why work with us?

It's easy to feel overwhelmed when thinking about all the processes you should take inventory of and potentially optimize to get the most ROI for your business. Where do you even start: should you tackle the warehouse, have a chat with your logistics team or take a look at production and manufacturing first? 

At Custom Programming Solutions, we do more than crunch numbers. We partner with you to define the challenges you face in your business every day, from product marketing to sales, production and delivery.

Of course, the numbers behind the strategy are critical to your success. To find the right answers to your problem, it's vital to have skilled professionals with comprehensive experience who not only know which algorithms, equations and systems to use but how to interpret the results, then put them into action.

Related skills: Machine learning has substantial overlap with algorithms and techniques that can be used in applied problems in the mathematical optimization space.
