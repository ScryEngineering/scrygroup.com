Whether you're a small business owner or the CTO of an organization employing thousands of workers, you use technology every day. 

Even in the most technological of projects, there will always be important non-technical elements. By understanding the context of these projects, we're able to meet business needs efficiently, while working in partnership with our clients. Sometimes, we take non-technical approaches to solving problems traditionally seen as technology related, and vice-versa.



We provide expertise on:

- Assessing problems and researching potential technological solutions 

- Comparing cost and profitability of solutions vs. other options 

- Staffing and hiring decisions. We offer advice on both the impact of skills required and the overall market for talent

- Technical leadership and team management
