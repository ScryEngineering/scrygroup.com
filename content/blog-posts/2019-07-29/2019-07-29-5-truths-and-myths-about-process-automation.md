There's a lot of information (and some hype) out there about what process automation can do for your business. How do you separate fact from fiction? In this post, we'll review some of the most common truths, myths and misconceptions business owners have when they start to consider automating their own processes. 

## Process automation can be rolled out as soon as the automated process is as good as a manual one.

**Myth.**

We should maintain high standards when deciding which processes to automate, since processes we choose to automate are evaluated for reliability on a different scale versus manual methods. 

Think of a process that needs a lot of oversight, but that works 95% of the time. Exceptions must be handled as they come up. While 95% might sound like a great success rate, this means that someone will have to intervene or make a correction once for every 20 times the process is run. If you approach the process manually you can intervene fairly easily, but if you fully automate the process, you'd have to have a triage system to fix issues or deal with exceptional cases. Suddenly, 95% is a bad success rate if there isn't a system in place to handle anything that goes wrong (and, [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) does apply to automation: Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong).



## Once a process has been automated, you don't need anyone to oversee it.

**Myth.**

Some think the much-cited cost savings that result from automating processes happen because automation replaces the need for human workers. This is a simplification that can prove dangerous, even outright false, depending on the process that's being automated. 

To say there is a lot of work involved in even partially automating a process is an understatement. Sometimes, you can get 90% of the way there, but to bridge the 10% gap to full automation may prove extremely expensive, perhaps cost-prohibitive. We advise assessing these factors on a case-by-case basis, then making an educated judgement call on whether automating 90% of a process is good enough. 

For example, consider Amazon shipping. If you're a small manufacturer that makes packing pellets and boxes, it might make sense for you to employ workers to load them manually onto a truck than to use robots and use Amazon Prime to fill your orders. Rather than automating small parts of a process, you may opt to stick with manual labour or invest that revenue in your product. 

When considering whether to partially or fully automate a process, we must remember that automation isn't free and it doesn't happen in isolation - there are often direct or indirect costs involved in doing it, and it's imperative to assess how much value it will bring, as well as the short-term and long-term impacts to your business overall. 



## Any process can be automated by anyone.
