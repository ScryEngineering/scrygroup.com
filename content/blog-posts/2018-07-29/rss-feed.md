We now have a RSS feed for this website!

<!-- end excerpt -->

At CPS we believe strongly in creating easy ways to access data. When we make software we try to make it as easy as possible for people to get the relevant data that they need when they need it.

RSS exists to make it easier to track updates to the contents of websites in a standardized format. In this regard setting up a RSS feed was a natural choice for us (a reader-friendly API to our content). It makes it easy for a reader of the site to find the content in an automated way. All the information is already up here, you could get all the information from the site by scraping it, but making it easier to interact with means you wouldn't need to do that.
