One of the questions we have been asked amidst the recent coronavirus pandemic is how our business will be impacted.

Because we are a distinctly remote-first company we are in a great position to keep working the same way we were before without needing to change much of how we are working internally. *Just like everyone else*, we **will** be impacted by external factors. We are travelling less and various aspects of our supply chain will definitely be impacted.

One of the most important things in times like these is to keep thinking clearly and to be as well informed about developments as possible.
The community must come first, *we will lose some profits but that is fine*. We as a company can only exist only on top of a strong society and we do not forget this.
So preserving the conditions that allow us to exist at all has to be our priority, and should be for all organizations out there.

## Don't step down from hard decisions

One of the toughest things in difficult times is making decisions. It is easy to do nothing but decisions must still be made and avoiding making the tough decisions tends to make things worse.

One thing that can help you be able to make decisions is to be very mindful of the amount of mental capacity you have available to you. *In times of stress you will have less capacity to think than normal*. Proactively planning 

## Build mental reserves to avoid panic

Building excess slack mental capacity is always important, but in difficult times this becomes critical.

Unimportant things need to be dropped.

In difficult times it is important to not panic.
Keep grounded and make the best decisions you can.

Make sure that people are getting enough sleep and are looking after themselves. Remind people to do the important things, even if these are thing that they would routinely do because in moments of added stress people forget things. This is why airlines, despite having exceptionally well trained professional flight staff, have pilot checklists, in tough stressful situations relying on your memory is unreliable.

Some tips:

- Limit notifications for your technology such as phones to just the essentials
- Get enough sleep
- If you are working on anything that is critical enough that missing a step due to forgetfulness would be very bad start making checklists to help your execution. The book "The checklist manifesto" has some good guidelines to how to create a good checklist.

## Flattening the curve

In times like these it's especially important to think about the impacts that people have on the entire society and health system.
We have always been fans of systems thinking, but now this type of thinking has taken on an importance to the health of our staff and our communities in a far more direct and serious way than it usually is.

One of the most important things is for everyone to do their part in reducing the peak demand placed on the health system. When the peak demand of the health system is exceeded many people will die, not just people with the virus, but anyone who needs modern healthcare who is unable to get it

## Working from home

In regular times it's important to make sure that people who are sick don't come into work, but in times like this it's essential for people to not come into work sick.

One of the best things that companies can do to help the community be less impacted by this pandemic is to help "flatten the curve", which means this is an important time to make sure that everyone who can work from home is forced to work from home.

## Clearing out the backlog

Every company has a backlog of tasks would be great to do but can't get around to.

Given that there's some time where it might be very much not "business as usual" be proactive in getting through those backlog of tasks that you can still do.







Please stay safe everyone!
