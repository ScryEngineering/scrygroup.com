One of the questions we have been asked amidst the recent coronavirus pandemic is how our business will be impacted.

Because we are a distinctly remote-first company we are in a great position to keep working the same way we were before without needing to change much of how we are working internally. *Just like everyone else*, we **will** be impacted by external factors. We are travelling less and various aspects of our supply chain will definitely be impacted.

One of the most important things in times like these is to keep thinking clearly and to be as well informed about developments as possible.
The community must come first, we will lose some profits but that is fine. We as a company can only exist only on top of a strong society and we do not forget this.
So preserving the conditions that allow us to exist at all has to be our priority, and should be for all organizations out there.

## Flattening the curve

In times like these it's especially important to think about the impacts that people have on the entire society and health system.
We have always been fans of systems thinking, but now this type of thinking has taken on an importance to the health of our staff and our communities in a far more direct and serious way than it usually is.

One of the most important things is for everyone to do their part in reducing the peak demand placed on the health system. When the peak demand of the health system is exceeded many people will die, not just people with the virus, but anyone who needs modern healthcare who is unable to get it


## Working from home

One of the best things that companies can do to help the community be less impacted by this pandemic is to help "flatten the curve" 

Please stay safe everyone!
