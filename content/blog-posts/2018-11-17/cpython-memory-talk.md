On Thursday I presented a talk about how CPython manages memory at the [Melbourne Python Users Group](https://wiki.python.org/moin/MelbournePUG).

The talk slides can be found here: https://github.com/CustomProgrammingSolutions/python-memory-management-talk

There's a number of notes in the slides so check out the presenter mode (by pressing `p`) to see those notes.

We would like to extend our thanks to [Python Charmers](https://pythoncharmers.com/) for hosting the event!
