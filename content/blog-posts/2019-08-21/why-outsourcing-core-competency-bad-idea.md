Why outsourcing your core competency is a bad idea 

As IT and software consultants who have spent years engineering specialty software, every so often a client will ask if they should consider outsourcing one aspect of their business or another. And we always respond with the same adage: "Never outsource your core competency."

> Outsourcing is the business practice of hiring a party outside a company to perform services and create goods that traditionally were performed in-house by the company's own employees and staff.  - [*Investopedia*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsourcing.asp)

A quick search for the phrase "Don't outsource your core competency" reveals many a cautionary tale and project-from-hell that could have been saved had founders kept their core service in-house and hired the technical talent they needed. 





> A lot of investors (including me) will refuse to fund a startup who has gone to one of the dev shops to build their product. Not only is it a sign that you can't execute independently (agencies make money when you are dependent on them after all), it also means that you don't have enough hustle to find your own tech person/people.
