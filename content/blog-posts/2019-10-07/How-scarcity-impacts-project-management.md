In the book Scarcity: The New Science of Having Less and How it Defines our Lives, authors Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir capture how scarcity can change the way we think and act in both our personal and professional lives. They devote a chapter to managing scarcity in organizations and beautifully articulate what short and long-term scarcity can do to projects, people and workplaces: 

> When we function under scarcity, we represent, manage and deal with problems differently. 

This can have either positive or negative effects - while we may become more 

While many systems need slack in order to work well, slack is often one of the first casualties when we feel pressed for time, budget, people or other resources. 

In the book, Mullainathan and Shafir encapsulate why this happens:

> We fail to build slack because we focus on what must be done now and do not think enough about all the things that can arise in the future. The present is imminently clear whereas future contingencies are less pressing and harder to imagine. When the intangible future comes face to face with a palpable present, slack feels like a luxury...(but) when you face scarcity, slack is a necessity.""
