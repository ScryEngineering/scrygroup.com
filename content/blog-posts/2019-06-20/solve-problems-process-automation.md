# 7 problems process automation can solve

If you've ever spent an entire day at the office slogging through a mountain of paperwork or felt your eyes glaze over while staring at  *another* simple customer inquiry on your screen, you know the feeling of wishing you could be doing almost anything else. Lucky for you, you can be. You can likely solve some of your most annoying problems with process automation.

In this post, we'll explain how automating your processes can help you get to inbox zero, respond to customer feedback, deploy software and more.

## Problem #1. You need to send emails to leads, customers and sales reps

**The situation:** You've collected a few hundred email addresses from leads you've met and conferences and regular clients, and added them to your list (with permission, right?). You hate letting them languish in your CRM, but you're not sure how to reach out.

**The fix:** Make marketing hassle-free by setting up email workflows using marketing automation software. Imagine if instead of having to chase each lead individually, you tracked your visitors' actions on your website. When they subscribe to your blog, fill out a contact form or download your content, it triggers an email to be sent - and all you had to do was set up the workflow once. STAT

Bonus: Don't lose your best opportunities to miscommunication. If you create a workflow that emails your sales person the info they need about visitors who engage with your pricing or contact page, you'll never let another lead fall through the cracks. Even better, your system sends the emails so you can focus on nurturing relationships.

## 2. You're overwhelmed with customer feedback and support requests

**The situation:** Have you ever had one of these days?: you get back from lunch and your phone is ringing with your 1:00 call. A regular customer is asking a question via chat. You've just received a Facebook message from a lead wanting more information on one of your products, and an email from a dissatisfied customer awaits your reply. Of course, all of them expect immediate attention.

Automating your processes will let you prioritize which of these can be handled purely through automation, solve performance problems and free up your support staff's time for the most urgent and complex issues.

**The fix:** Leverage machine learning and AI (artificial intelligence), to significantly improve your customer experience. By using a chat bot to answer simple questions received through social media and your website, you can streamline your service department, eliminate inefficiencies and send the most complex problems to your staff to be addressed. Machine learning and natural language processing can also be used to define types of requests and segment them. 

For example, if you run an online store visitors might have questions before ordering, need to return an item or require help with a shipping issue. Accurately segmenting these means these requests will be handled faster and in a more organized fashion. 



## 3. Everyone dreads entering data and creating reports

**The situation:** You loathe the thought of having to hire, train and manage another employee for such a simple task, but you've got hundreds of spreadsheets to manage and reports to generate on a regular basis. It's become a running joke on your team about who gets stuck doing it every month and worse, errors creep in. You can't be sure it's getting completed accurately and you think there must be a faster way.

**The fix:** Your instincts are correct. 



Use a chat bot to answer simple questions that come up most frequently. 

Error-prone processes focused on execution 



- modifying spreadsheets 

- Generating reports / data entry 

- Continuous integration pipelines 

  Someone writes some code, pushes it to Git and automated scripts run automated testing on the code just pushed. This will give a pass/fail based on the pipeline that's set up. This is good for ensuring basic QA (Quality Assurance?). can put all sorts of things into such a pipeline. 

  Just about all good software product teams do this.

- Automation of deployments
