It's important to know if your content creation and editing workflow requires you to be connected to the internet.

<!-- end excerpt -->

Given that we are regularly flying around to consult with clients we frequently find ourselves in situations where it is important to be able to continue our work even when an internet connection is not available.

Granted that in 2019 internet is more ubiquitous but having to have an internet connection to be able to edit content is a big productivity drain at times.

The main reason this impacts productivity is that having to have a connection means your editing experience is centralized.
Often when writing you will want to jot down some notes or make some edits to existing content on the go.
With the rise of distributed version control systems such as Git (what we use for our content) and Mercurial you retain the power to edit documents without the associated issues that come up from having to merge all of your changes manually.

## What this means for people creating content systems

Think carefully about what your users need when editing content. In many cases it's easier to work with the assumption that your users have high speed internet that's always on, and always fast and perhaps always low latency.

But these assumptions will cause pain when they do not hold.

TODO: explain some pain points.


## Simultaneous editing

This is perhaps one application of centralized content editing that's worth the tradeoff.
