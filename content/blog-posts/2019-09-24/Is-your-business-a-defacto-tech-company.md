In 2019, virtually every business uses technology in some capacity, but how do you know when you've crossed the line from not using technology to depending on it? You might be surprised to find that there's no established threshold. In this post, we explore how to tell if your business is a defacto tech company. 

## What is a defacto tech company?

As software consultants, we've met many business owners who don't see technology as being a core part of their business, even when it clearly is. 

For example, within a relatively short timespan, automation has drastically changed how bricks-and-mortar businesses operate. We can now automate tedious tasks such as data entry, sorting and responding to emails, appointment scheduling, sending recurring invoices, customer support and more. 

You might start with a few Excel spreadsheets before moving on to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and ordering, and be automating with APIs before you know it. 

The logistics industry is another timely example - just a few years ago, no one would have thought of a trucking business as tech-oriented, but even "traditional" companies like these have gradually shifted to more tech-heavy with the arrival of autonomous driving vehicles.

There's no arguing that the advent of technology has changed everything from the tools we use to complete our work efficiently to which industries thrive or die. But there's a clear distinction between whether we're using these technologies as a consumer or as a producer. 

In automation, those lines are often substantially blurred. For illustrations of this, look no further than Excel for data analysis or WordPress for content. Historically, most technologies had at least three levels of users:

- Beginner or casual user 

  This is the bucket most of us fall into; casual users who use the tool or software on a regular basis. We understand enough to get done what we need to (or who/where to ask for help), but wouldn't qualify as experts). 

- Admin or expert user 

  These are highly skilled users with advanced expertise. They're sometimes assigned additional administrative rights and responsibilities depending on their role and requirements.

- Producer or Creator 

  These people created, developed and released these systems and technologies. 

Sometimes, these roles can evolve depending on your situation and requirements. For example, most WordPress users use plugins on top of their plain WordPress install to extend the functionality of their websites. They may have a third party create a new plugin to meet their needs. While they're still a consumer in terms of capacities, it becomes blurry quite quickly if their business strongly depends on the features and functions of that plugin. In other capacities, your business might use a technology, but not rely on it. 

In some cases, the transition between consumer and producer is driven by business concerns and in others, it's driven by talent issues. With some consulting gigs, it can be exceedingly profitable (and possible) for consumers to become producers (think of people who use a cloud service for convenience as consumers, but then take that service back in-house to save on costs). 

SaaS (Software as a Service), these roles can sometimes become less definitive, as 

While you can obviously use these tools as a user, there are also power users (people whose skills and expertise are more advanced than most casual users and who are sometimes assigned additional administrative rights and responsibilities)
