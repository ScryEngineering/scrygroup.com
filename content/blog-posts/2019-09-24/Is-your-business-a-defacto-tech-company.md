Whether we're hailing a ride, ordering food to our door or shopping online, we buy from businesses that call themselves tech companies almost every day.

But what really makes a tech company, and how do you know if you are one? Are there advantages and drawbacks to calling yourself one? Today, we'll explore what it means to be a tech company in 2019 and beyond.

## What is a tech company, anyway?

When most of us think of "tech companies", we still picture multi-billion dollar social networks, computer manufacturers and SaaS companies like Facebook, Instagram, Apple, Google, Spotify, Dropbox and more. But the definition of a tech company is much broader and fuzzier than many realize. 

While it definitely [includes businesses that focus on developing and manufacturing technology as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company), in recent years it's expanded to encompass [definitions like these](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201605/marli-guzzetta/tech-company-definition.html), as covered by Inc. Magazine:

"You are a technology company if you are in the business of selling technology - if you make money by selling applied scientific knowledge that solves a concrete problem."  - Alex Payne, Co-Founder, Simple 

"A tech company uses technology to create an unfair advantage in terms of product uniqueness or scale or improved margins. Ask the question: Could this company exist without technology? If the answer is no, it has to be a tech company." - Greg Bettinelli, Partner, Upfront Ventures

"I think there's a false dichotomy in the idea that a company either is or is not a tech company. I think it's possible for a company to be a hybrid if tech is giving it an edge over incumbents." - Hayley Barna, Venture Partner, First Round Capital

## Questions to ask yourself

As software consultants, we've met many business owners who don't see technology as being a core part of their business when it clearly is. 

To find out whether you've got a blind spot in this area, look around at your office and staff and ask yourself these questions: 

- How are you fulfilling your company's technical needs? 
- How many of the technologies you use today are mission critical to your business (in other words, you couldn't operate your business at full capacity without them)?
- Will your current suppliers, vendors and technologies be around in the next three, five, ten (or even two) years?
- Are you a consumer or producer of technology (or both)?

In the 21st century, every single company has technical needs and dependencies. If your first thought is that you'd have to close up shop if you lost your most technically intelligent staff or could no longer access the tools they use, you are likely a tech company. If nothing would change, you're clearly not one.

For example, within a relatively short timespan, automation has drastically changed how both digital and bricks-and-mortar businesses operate. We can now automate tedious tasks such as data entry, sorting and responding to emails, appointment scheduling, sending recurring invoices, customer support and more. 

You might start with a few Excel spreadsheets before moving on to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and ordering, and be automating with APIs before you know it. 

The logistics industry is another timely example - just a few years ago, no one would have thought of a trucking business as tech-oriented, but even "traditional" companies like these have gradually shifted to become more tech-heavy with the arrival of autonomous driving vehicles. 

We can also look to the airline industry; without using technology for everything from security to flight control and navigation, every airport in the world would be at a standstill. 

There's also a clear distinction between whether we're using these technologies as a consumer or as a producer. 

In automation, those lines are often substantially blurred. For illustrations of this, look no further than Excel for data analysis or WordPress for content management. Historically, most technologies had at least three levels of users:

- Beginner or casual user 

  This is the bucket most of us fall into; casual users who use the tool or software on a regular basis. We understand enough to get done what we need to (or who/where to ask for help), but wouldn't qualify as experts). 

- Admin or expert user 

  These are highly skilled users with advanced expertise. They're sometimes assigned additional administrative rights and responsibilities depending on their role and requirements.

- Producer or Creator 

  These people created, developed and released these systems and technologies. 

Sometimes, these roles can evolve depending on your situation and requirements. For example, most WordPress users use plugins on top of their plain WordPress install to extend the functionality of their websites. They may have a third party create a new plugin to meet their needs. While they're still a consumer in terms of capacities, it becomes blurry quite quickly if their business strongly depends on the features and functions of that plugin. In other capacities, your business might use a technology, but not rely on it. 

In some cases, the transition between consumer and producer is driven by business concerns and in others, it's driven by talent issues. With some consulting gigs, it can be exceedingly profitable (and possible) for consumers to become producers (consider people who use a cloud service for convenience as consumers, but then take that service back in-house to save on costs). 

In SaaS (Software as a Service), producer/consumer roles can sometimes become less definitive, as people who were once producers become consumers of a product (think subscription-based software that lets you edit photos, create proposals, manage documents or content, do your accounting and more).

When considering whether to rely on technology built by third parties or produce it in-house, consider the continuity risk to your business. Look to Microsoft Excel for an example - (DETAILS) . In this case, using external tools would have been a massive liability; it made sense not to outsource these things, since they were at the core of what makes the product unique. 

If the people behind Excel lost the ability to change the core functionality due to a third party's decisions, the entire product would effectively die. Many technology products face a similar situation; they can't outsource their technology since the technology is their core competency. 

In Excel's case, continuity risk isn't the only factor - it would be exceptionally difficult to find another party who could maintain and grow the software. This is partly why deciding whether to outsource is one of the most meaningful decisions a tech company has to make (if outsourcing is even possible considering their circumstances). 

Sometimes, non-technical managers - especially those with expertise in commodity products but not tech - mistakenly assume a third party always exists or is available to supply key components, even at high price points. This isn't always the case, and can prove to be a serious error that can result in costly delays or cancellation, and of course, lost revenue and opportunities.



## The takeaway: Every company is technical to some degree 

Companies continue to automate their systems extensively and often don't have non-technical redundancies or backups on hand. While we often compare our own use of technology to that of tech giants, this is a distraction. 

Remember: How technical any other company is is irrelevant. What matters is whether you need technical experts on staff, how you plan to find, hire and retain them, and that their skills and job descriptions should match your needs.
