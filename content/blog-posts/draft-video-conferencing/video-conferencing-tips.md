I've been in self isolation for ten days now.  I have no fever, and was prescribed antibiotics yesterday for what turns out to be a sinus infection. Hallelujah. It's good to be alive.

Isolation was not easy.  While I regularly work from my office at Home... I quickly missed the things that made up my normal routine.

I gave up my daily coffee run.  My date nights with girlfriends at the mall. I lost the freedom to come and go from the grocery store. And felt awkward going for even a short walk around the block, as I was advised to keep two metres betwen myself and anyone else.

It was a lot of changes all at once, and I am ever so grateful that I have been using Zoom Meeting for video conferencing for business.  Because I was able to take my knowledge, of the ease of use of Zoom Conferencing, and teach my Friends and Family to connect with me in a new way.

My Uncle is 72 years old.  I have just come out of self isolation to find that my freedom remains severed from what I knew as the norm and the outbreak has become a pandemic.

What better time to teach the Elderly, and anyone lucky enough to come across this article... How to Use Zoom for Video Conferencing. Along with the essentials of Etiquette for Online Conferencing.

Video calling is an included feature via the Facetime App on iPhones, but not everyone has an iPhone.  Zoom can be installed on any modern smart phone, or tablet. If your laptop has a built in camera and microphone you're all set.  Bonus points if you've got a set of headphones with inline mic.  They increase calling clarity, and make it easier to speak and be heard.

I have noticed, as my timem alone went on, a general urge, to be out.  Seeing and chatting wtih a Friendly face on screen was essential to combatting those ill feelings of unease, more so than I believe a standard phone call can.

I've had tea with my Best Friend Cat. And it's nearly as comforting as sitting across from her in the living room.

I've touched base with my Auntie on the East Coast.  The sun was shining outside her window. And it was reassuring to see how healthy she looked.

I've held regular sit ins with our business team here at Scry.  The health of our business being second, to the advice being shared in the scramble and dash to find peace amongst chaos in our ever changing societies around the globe.

I'm not going to go into details of how to use Zoom.  The specifics will differ slightly depending on your platform.

I can say, they have set it up incredibly well to make the onboarding process simmple and straight forward.

My Uncle, at age 72, was sent the Zoom link.. then after downloading the app, registering with an email, confirming the email, made his first test call.  All within 20 minutes, of his own time.

Seven minutes later we were live streaming between Quebec, and Niagara Falls, and it was incredibly pleasant.  He lives in a small community in the country amongst Farmers and Retirees, and was excited to learn Zoom so that others could be taught to use it too.

Zoom is normally a paid platform for calls with more than two participants. However, during this period of crisis, calling for more than two people is being gifted to us. Free of charge. For as many minutes as you need.

Please feel free to reach out to [rose@scrygroup.com](mailto:rose@scrygroup.com) if you have stories of how video calling is impacting your life.  I'd be glad to hear them and connect with you.
