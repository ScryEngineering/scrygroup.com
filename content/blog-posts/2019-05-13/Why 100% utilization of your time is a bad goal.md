# Why 100% utilization of your time is a bad goal 

Do you ever look at your calendar and wonder where the week (or month) went? Thinking back, you may be startled that you've become one of those people who responds with "crazy busy" when you're asked how things are going. You admit to feeling a twinge of pride at your success - a few years ago you would have killed to have the clients and opportunities you do today. But you're also exhausted, overwhelmed and concerned about what the future holds. After all, how long can you and your team keep running at 100% capacity without a break, or taking time to decide where you're headed? 

The answer: not long. Whether this is your situation now or you're headed here, working at 100% capacity means you miss out on opportunities to grow. Worse, you'll actively put the health of yourself, your team and your entire business at risk. In this post, we'll break down why it's a terrible idea to use 100% of your time on current projects, how businesses end up in this trap and what you can do to keep it from happening.

## The problem with 100% utilization

There are a few problems with booking out 100% of your time. Here are the ones we see that have had the most negative impact on clients we've worked with in the past:

### You don't have any time to assess priorities and processes 

Processes aren't just a "set it and forget" thing. They're the foundation of everything you do in your business, so they need to be kept lean, reviewed regularly and updated (or revamped) when required. We suggest our clients review their processes annually, preferably before you take end-of-year holidays since everyone is in a reflective state of mind. 

When you've got 100% of your team and 100% of your calendar full, there's no time for those critical breaks to work *on* your business vs. *in* it. That's a huge problem for companies of any size, because outdated or incomplete processes mean things start to slip through the cracks. Dedicating time to assess your priorities and processes, and whether you're on course to achieve your goals, is crucial to your long-term success.

### Customer service suffers 

Customers are at the heart of any business; without them, there's no revenue, no product or service to sell, and no staff. It's often the little details - a last review before sending your work to a client, a brief phone call to clarify a request, or an extra half-hour spent fixing a problem before they spot it - that differentiate you from the competition and turn your client into an ambassador for your business. 

Tragically, these are also the first details to be missed when staff time and workload aren't managed appropriately. Clients are the first ones to suffer, but if they leave to work with your competition, the impact can be devastating - not only on the project and on your current cashflow, but the long-term impact on your reputation could be severe  (since customers are far more likely to talk about poor experiences than good ones). 

### You won't be able to respond to emergencies as quickly as you need to 

In the lifespan of any business, disaster is likely to strike at least once.

### You won't have any bandwidth for business development and growth 

Business development and growth can be compared to growing a vegetable garden in your backyard; it as long as you consistently maintain it, plant regularly and balance out your crops (grow your business using a number of different methods), you'll be well-fed. But forget about it, or do too much of one thing, and you'll be in trouble. It's imperative to make time to plant these seeds of growth before you're (quite literally) starving for business, because your busy days won't last forever.

Skills development gets put on the back burner 

Work-life balance flies out the window 

Employees don't learn how to effectively manage their time



## How did we get here?

'How did things get this out of hand?' you ask yourself. There are a few reasons this can happen:

**Poor, fear-based management**

There's no way to sugarcoat this harsh reality. Some businesses are badly managed for so long that toxic culture permeates the company. Short-sighted, incompetent leaders can leave a devastating impact on employees and their environment long after they depart or retire. 

Bad leaders often use fear to wield power over staff, and implement unrealistic expectations and policies. One of those is that staff are seen as nothing more than behinds in seats, cost centres who must generate revenue for the business. And they're *always* expected to be productive and within reach. Good employees either wither under this type of leadership, or leave in search of healthier environments. 

**Leadership and staff gradually slip into bad habits** 

We've all had those months where we've pulled consecutive all-nighters to hit a deadline, only to barely take a breath before moving on to the next item on our to-do list. You promise yourself you'll get a handle on your time before kicking off the next project, but it never seems to happen. 

This scenario can happen in companies managed by well-intentioned but overwhelmed leaders. Left unchecked, it can become the norm by default. However, the results are the same: leaders model acceptable behaviour, and both longtime and new staff take note (consciously or sub-consciously) and behave accordingly. The result: an erosion of best practices and a descent into dysfunctional culture.

**Chronic understaffing**

This can be a separate issue or a result of the company being poorly managed. No matter the cause, sudden mass layoffs or gradual attrition leaves employees chronically overworked, resentful, ineffective and eventually, burnt out or sick. Even the most dedicated staff members won't be able to keep up if they're chronically swamped. 



Now that we understand the problem of 100% time utilization and how it's caused, let's look at how to prevent it from happening at all. 

## What can you do?

Limit the time you spend on each project or task

Staff appropriately and build extra time into each project 

Dedicate time to strategy, learning and skills development

Insist employees balance work with personal time
