# Why 100% utilization of your time is a bad goal 

Do you ever look at your calendar and wonder where the week (or month) went? Thinking back, you may be startled that you've become one of those people who responds with "crazy busy" when you're asked how things are going. You admit to feeling a twinge of pride at your success - a few years ago you would have killed to have the clients and opportunities you do today. But you're also exhausted, overwhelmed and concerned about what the future holds. After all, how long can you and your team keep running at 100% capacity without a break, or taking time to decide where you're headed? 

The answer: not long. Whether this is your situation now or you're headed here, working at 100% capacity means you miss out on opportunities to grow. Worse, you'll actively put the health of yourself, your team and your entire business at risk. In this post, we'll break down how this happens in the first place, and why it's a terrible idea to use 100% of your time on current projects. 

## How did we get here?

'How did things get this out of hand?' you ask yourself. There are a few reasons this can happen:

**Poor, fear-based management**

There's no way to sugarcoat this harsh reality. Some businesses are badly managed for so long that toxic culture permeates the company. Short-sighted, incompetent leaders can leave a devastating impact on employees and their environment long after they depart or retire. 

Bad leaders often use fear to wield power over staff, and implement unrealistic expectations and policies. One of those is that staff are seen as nothing more than behinds in seats, cost centres who must generate revenue for the business. And they're *always* expected to be productive and within reach. Good employees either wither under this type of leadership, or leave in search of healthier environments. 

**Leadership and staff gradually slip into bad habits** 

We've all had those months where we've pulled consecutive all-nighters to hit a deadline, only to barely take a breath before moving on to the next item on our to-do list. You promise yourself you'll get a handle on your time before kicking off the next project, but it never seems to happen. 

This scenario can happen in companies managed by well-intentioned but overwhelmed leaders. However, the results are the same: leaders model acceptable behaviour, and both longtime and new staff take note (consciously or sub-consciously) and behave accordingly. The result: an erosion of best practices and a descent into dysfunctional culture.

**Chronic understaffing**

This can be a separate issue or a result of the company being poorly managed. No matter the cause, sudden mass layoffs or gradual attrition leaves employees chronically overworked, resentful, ineffective and eventually, burnt out or ill. Even the most dedicated staff members won't be able to keep up if they're chronically swamped. 

Corporate and popular culture tend to glorify being busy to an extreme. The rationale is if you're not productive 100% of the time, you're 

people applaud you for your success, deep down you feel exhausted, overwhelmed and behind on the important stuff. 

## The problem with 100% utilization 

You don't have any time to assess priorities and processes 

Customer service suffers 

You won't be able to respond to emergencies as quickly as you need to 

You won't have any bandwidth for business development and growth 

Skills development gets put on the back burner 

Work-life balance flies out the window
