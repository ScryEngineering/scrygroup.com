Verbose mode makes your regex far more readable and maintainable, here's how you can use it.

<!-- end excerpt -->

Before I found out about the verbose mode that is offered in Python I was always far more hesitant to use regex due to issues with readability.

Let's look at an example, parsing emails with regex. For some example text lets use [Office Ipsum](http://officeipsum.com/) with a sprinkling of emails and not-quite-emails:

```python
office_ipsum = """

Low-hanging fruit. When does this sunset?
"""
```

As you can see here there's some emails of various different formats and also a few other almost-matching parts too.

(Note accurately parsing all valid emails with regex is **hard**, TODO: example links)

Here's an email pattern specified in the verbose mode:

```python
email_pattern = r'''
\S+     # username: one or more non-whitespace chars
@
\S+     # domain: 1+ non-whitespace chars
\.      # matches exactly a dot
[a-zA-Z]+
'''
```

Non verbose mode looks like this:

```python
email_p = r'\S+@\S+\.[a-zA-Z]+'
```

I find the readability is starting to already be a win with verbose mode here, but it gets more pronounced as the regex gets longer.

## Capture groups

Let's try to capture the name in email:

```python
email_name_only_re = r'''
(?P<name>    # capture this following block into name
  \S+        # username: one or more non-whitespace chars
)
@
\S+        # domain: 1+ non-whitespace chars
\.         # matches exactly a dot
[a-zA-Z]+  # matches characters
'''
```

This will capture the name. You can use the indentation to show the scope of the capture group.

```python
names = re.findall(email_name_only_re, office_ipsum, flags=re.VERBOSE)
print(names)
```

TODO: output

## Capture of the entire domain

```python
email_capture_re = r'''
(?P<entire_email>
    (?P<name>    # capture this following block into name
      \S+        # username: one or more non-whitespace chars
    )
    @
    (?P<domain>  # capture this following block into domain
      \S+        # domain: 1+ non-whitespace chars
      \.         # matches exactly a dot
      [a-zA-Z]+  # matches characters
    )
)
'''
```


## Capturing the TLD

TODO test this

```python
email_capture_re = r'''
(?P<entire_email>
    (?P<name>    # capture this following block into name
      \S+        # username: one or more non-whitespace chars
    )
    @
    (?P<domain>  # capture this following block into domain
      \S+        # domain: 1+ non-whitespace chars
      \.         # matches exactly a dot
      (?P<tld>   # capture this following block into tld
        [a-zA-Z]+  # matches characters
      )
    )
)
'''
```
