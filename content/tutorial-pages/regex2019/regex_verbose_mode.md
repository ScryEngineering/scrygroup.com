Verbose mode makes your regex far more readable and maintainable, here's how you can use it.

<!-- end excerpt -->

Before I found out about the verbose mode that is offered in Python I was always far more hesitant to use regex due to issues with readability.

Let's look at an example, parsing emails with regex. For some example text lets use [Office Ipsum](http://officeipsum.com/) with a sprinkling of emails and not-quite-emails:

```python
office_ipsum = """
It's a simple lift and shift job. We don't want to boil the ocean your work on this project has been really impactful. Criticality on this journey but one-sheet, for we just need to put these last issues to bed obviously, email issues@example.com. Locked and loaded organic growth@10%. Wheelhouse out of scope.

```

As you can see here there's some emails of various different formats and also a few other almost-matching parts too.

(Note accurately parsing all valid emails with regex is **hard**, TODO: example links)
