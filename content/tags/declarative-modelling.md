name: declarative modelling
---
Declarative modelling is an approach to solving problems with software that focuses on problem specification more than the details of execution.
This paradigm focuses on the logic and structure of *what* must be solved and puts less focus on specifying the steps in *how* a solution is found.

This is in contrast to imperative programming, a paradigm that focuses on specifying the order of computations explicitly.
