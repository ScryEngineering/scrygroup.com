[Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) is a runtime environment and interpreter for Javascript code that runs outside a web browser.

While Javascript had existed for some time as a scripting language in web browsers there wasn't an implementation with widespread adoption that ran outside the browser until Node.js (which was first released in 2009). This has enabled people to use Javascript to write scripts and applications on servers. This has led to people using Javascript to write backend code and has led to a large ecosystem of packages and projects that are written in Javascript. Because of the asynchronous event loop driven nature of Node.js it can handle many concurrent connections from a single machine when running as a backend web server, something that has been a key factor in its popularity.
