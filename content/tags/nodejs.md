[Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) is a runtime environment and interpreter for Javascript code that runs outside a web browser.

While Javascript had existed for some time as a scripting language in web browsers there wasn't an implementation that ran outside the browser until Node.sj was first released in 2009. This has enabled people to use Javascript to write scripts and applications on servers. This has led to people using Javascript to write backend code and has led to a large ecosystem of packages and projects that are written in Javascript.
