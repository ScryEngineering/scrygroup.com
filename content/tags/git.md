[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).

Git is currently one of the most popular Version Control Systems in use, it is open source, extremely high performance and has extensive usage in very many large projects.
Git is unashamedly a power user oriented tool which means that the learning curve to get started is relatively steep.
However it is one of the best version control tools in existence for regular users due to the raw power it gives you.
