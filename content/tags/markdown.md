Markdown is a lightweight plain-text markup language that will allow you to create documents with formatting.
Due to its simplicity it has become very popular as a lightweight format for creating documents.
Because of it's plain text nature you can use an ordinary text editor to edit your documents and this will also play nicely with version control systems.
Because of way in which markdown documents are able to nicely work with version control various web sites are built using what's known as a Javascript and Markdown stack (JAM stack) that will take page contents from markdown sources and render them nicely into webpages.

The [original Markdown specification](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is the one with which various extensions have been built upon.
There are multiple implementations of markdown in common use:

- The original [Daring Fireball Markdown specification](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
  - [GitHub Flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (which is an extension of CommonMark)
- [MultiMarkdown](https://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)

This summary itself was written in markdown and has been transformed via our web publishing pipeline into the web page you are currently seeing.
