Markdown is a lightweight plaintext markup language that allows you to create documents with basic formatting while being readable without the formatting.
Due to its simplicity it has become very popular as a lightweight format for authoring documents.
Because of its plain text nature you can use an ordinary text editor to edit your documents and this will also play nicely with version control systems.
Because of the way in which Markdown documents are able to nicely work with version control, various web sites are built using what is known as a JavaScript and Markdown stack (JAM stack) that reads page contents from Markdown sources and renders them nicely into webpages.

The [original Markdown specification](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) has been built on through various extensions.
There are multiple implementations of Markdown in common use:

- The original [Daring Fireball Markdown specification](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (an extension of CommonMark)
- [MultiMarkdown](https://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)

This summary itself was written in Markdown and has been transformed via our web publishing pipeline into the web page you are currently reading.
