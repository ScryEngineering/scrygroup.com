Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a more recent version of the Internet Protocol, used mainly for delivering packets to addressed endpoints on various networks such as the public internet.

This protocol exists to address the shortcomings of the IPv4 protocol that have become apparent with the worldwide growth of the internet, mainly the exhaustion of available IP addresses.
This protocol has a larger address space than IPv4 which it is replacing, the specification for this can be found in [RFC 4291](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291).
