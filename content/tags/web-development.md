Web development refers to the areas of software and product development that is involved in creating web products.

Since the massive rise of the internet in day to day life this area of work has greatly expanded in recent times.

From a software development point of view web development tends to be grouped into two broad categories based on where the code is running:

- Backend development
- Frontend development

Since web development is often concerned with product development a number of other sub-specialties that have come into prominence in the modern web development world including user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) work.
