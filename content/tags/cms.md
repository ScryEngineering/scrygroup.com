Content Management Systems (CMSs) are systems designed to allow the creation and management of digital material.

When dealing with large amounts of content it is especially useful to have systems that can help you deal with the various tasks of managing that content and the workflows used for doing useful things with that content.

There's a large number of CMS software systems, both open source and proprietary, in common usage. Some common CMS software includes:

- [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) (Python/Django based)
- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) (PHP based)
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) (PHP based)

Increasingly popular are headless CMS systems, these are CMS systems that will only manage the content and will not do any of the web server portions of serving the actual content pages. There's a number of potential benefits of setting up a system this way, especially with security.
