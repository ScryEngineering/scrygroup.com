[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is a Javascript package manager.

One of the main benefits of using Yarn is that it provides the ability to create deterministic and repeatable builds.
This addressed a very significant shortcoming of other javascript package managers that could install different dependencies depending on the build order.
