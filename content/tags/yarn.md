[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is a JavaScript package manager.

One of the main benefits of using Yarn is that it provides the ability to create deterministic and reproducible builds.
This addressed a very significant shortcoming of other JavaScript package managers that sometimes installed different dependencies depending on the build order.
