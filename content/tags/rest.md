name: REST

Representational state transfer (REST) is an approach to the architecture of web services and the term was introduced by Roy Fielding in [his doctoral thesis](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm).

REST is a group of constraints that has a number of positive side effects when designing and writing web services, including performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.

The REST constraints are:

- Client-server architecture
- Statelessness
- Cacheability
- Layered system
- Code on demand (optional)
- Uniform interface
