Mypy is a type checker for Python that can allow you to introduce static type checking into our projects.

Introducing optional static typing into Python has a very large number of benefits that grow in importance when your project size and complexity increases. Python is an extremely dynamic language that will allow you to be extremely flexible with the types that are passed around. With this flexibility comes the possibility to introduce a number of type related bugs, introducing tooling that will allow you to check how the types of variables flow through your program allows you to detect many subtle bugs before you run your code.
