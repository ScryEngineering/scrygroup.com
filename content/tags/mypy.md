[Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) is a type checker for Python that allows you to introduce static type checking into your projects.

Introducing optional static typing into Python has a large number of benefits that grow in importance when project size and complexity increases. Python is an extremely dynamic language that allows you to be very flexible with the types that are passed around. With this flexibility comes the possibility to introduce a number of type related bugs. Introducing tooling that will allow you to check how the types of variables flow through your program allows you to detect many subtle bugs before you even run your code.
