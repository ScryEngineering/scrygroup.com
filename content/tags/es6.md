ECMA Script version 6 (ES6) is a standardized version of JavaScript that introduces a substantial upgrade and modernization of the JavaScript language. Released in 2015, it includes a number of improvements over the previous JavaScript standards that were in use at the time.

This version of the language introduced many constructs that are highly useful for developers including:

- Better handling of variable scope and constants
- Modules
- Classes
- Set and Map data types
- Arrow functions
- Promises
