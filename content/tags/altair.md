[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a visualization library based on the [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and Vega lite projects.

Altair aims to provide a declarative style of syntax for specifying statistical visualizations.
Altair is often used in [Jupyter notebooks](/tags/jupyter) and other interactive environments as it gives you a great way to do interactive visualizations of data.
Since these visualizations are built using the javascript based Vega library it is possible to then reuse these visualizations in a deployed web app fairly easily.
