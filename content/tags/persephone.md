The persephone ASR project is an open source tool which allows you automate speech-to-phoneme transcriptions.
It is built with a machine learning engine that can be trained on your own labelled audio test data and has been successfully used with many spoken languages worldwide. Due the the ability to get results from small sets of labeled training data it has found use in the study of low resource languages. (See [this paper](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01709648/document) for more info)
It can run on premise on your own machines and is capable of running on both CPU and GPU hardware.
