[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a web based platform that allows you to create documents that contain executable code along with text, equations, images and visualizations.

This has become a very popular communications medium for people who have to work with code but are ultimately creating artifacts consumed by other people and not computer. This is especially popular in data science and analytics related areas where there's both a substantial presentation component and a substantial code component to the work.
