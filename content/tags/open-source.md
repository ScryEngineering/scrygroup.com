Open source is a term that is used to refer to software which has licenses that permit people to directly see the source code behind the software they are using.

The term is most commonly used to refer to software that is distributed under a permissive, or even a copy-left license. Permissive licenses such as the MIT, ISC, and Apache licenses allow the software to be used in virtually any project, whereas copy-left licenses such as the GPL and AGPL require any projects using the code to also be distributed under a similar open source license.

The term also can refer to the community that surrounds open source software development.
