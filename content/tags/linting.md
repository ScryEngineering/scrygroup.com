name: linting
---
Linting is the process of performing static code analysis to check code for errors, bugs, and potentially dangerous constructs. The name *linting* is derived from the [UNIX lint tool](https://www.unix.com/man-page/FreeBSD/1/lint/) that was used to check C code.

We extensively use linting techniques in our projects as we have found the use of mature linting tools to be an extremely effective way to create higher quality deliverables *and* simultaneously speed up our time to delivery.
By finding bugs at earlier stages in development the costs of fixing those bugs is greatly reduced.
