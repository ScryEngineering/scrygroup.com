[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is a library that provides access to SQL databases from Python.

The library contains a powerful Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and a variety of tools for dealing with raw SQL which it refers to as "Core".

This toolkit is a powerful way to specify SQL from your Python code as it has compatibility with many SQL dialects and implementations.
