Process automation [is a service we offer](https://www.scrygroup.com/services/process-automation-and-optimization/).

A crucial aspect of a good process automation project is determining how valuable processes are to automate, if a process isn't valuable then the effort spent on automating it is unlikely to be worthwhile.
