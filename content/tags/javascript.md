name: javascript

JavaScript is a programming language that has got popular as the scripting language of the internet. Orginally the internet consisted of just static pages, JavaScript was introduced as a scripting language in the Netscape browser to allow the possibility of more dynamic page content that could be scripted. Other web browsers implemented version of this soon afterwards. These implementations however differed slightly and a standardization effort for Javascript was undertaken. This standardized language is ECMAScript [for which the standard can be found here](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm).

Informally JavaScript is used to refer to the ECMAScript programming language. The name JavaScript was chosen as a marketing decision due to the rising popularity of the Java language, although those languages share *almost nothing* in common with regards to design.
