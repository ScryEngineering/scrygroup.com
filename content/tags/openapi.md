[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) is a set of standards to help you define and create modern APIs that are machine readable and can be easily consumed.
There is a large amount of quality tooling available to you if you choose to create your APIs in such a way.
There are also a number of benefits from being able to make machine readable API specifications including:

- Unambiguous definition of what API endpoints are supported and what format they are expecting.
- The ability to automatically check API endpoint routing matches the required specification.
- The ability to automatically validate API requests.
