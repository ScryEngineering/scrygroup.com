[Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator that aims to make pages with fast page load speeds.
It is built in the [NodeJS](/tags/nodejs) ecosystem and has very tight integration with ReactJS.

One common/popular use case for Gatsby is to pull content from a content management system (CMS) running in a headless mode.
This allows you to manage the content workflows in the CMS tool but to generate pages that can load far more efficiently and quickly compared to if they were served by the CMS system itself.
