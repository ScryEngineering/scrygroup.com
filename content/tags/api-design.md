name: API design

There are many things that go into creating a good Application Programming Interface (API) design.
Good API design is about enabling good flows of *information*.
Some guiding principles that we like to use include:

- Well documented
- Discoverability
- Verifiable
- Sensible [versioning](/tags/versioning) (Usually using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) or sometimes [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/))

Bonuses include:

- Allows for good tooling
- Efficient resource usage
